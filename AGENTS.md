## Dimensional Programming Model

Everything in this codebase is expressed as a **dimension**. Each higher dimension is a single point viewed from the next dimension up. Moving down collapses a whole into a point; moving up expands a point into a whole.

```
0D  void / scalar      — a single value; no extent
1D  point → line       — a length of points
2D  line  → plane      — a width of lines
3D  plane → volume     — a height of planes
4D  volume → object    — an object as a point in the next void
nD  recurse upward     — every whole at level n is a point at level n+1
```

### Laws

| Law | Statement |
|-----|-----------|
| **Identity** | `Manifold = Expression + Attributes + Substrate` |
| **Universal access** | `z = x · y` — the higher dimension derives and contains the lower |
| **Recursion scope** | Recurse **between** dimensions; never try to recurse within one |
| **Iteration scope** | Iterate **within** a dimension; never iterate across dimension boundaries |
| **Collapse** | Any n-D whole is a single point at dimension n+1 |
| **Expansion** | Any point at dimension n+1 unfolds into a full n-D manifold |

### Practical application in this repo

- **Substrate files** operate at one dimension. A board substrate (3D) never owns time logic (4D) — time is a separate lens one dimension up.
- **Lenses** are pure functions that project a manifold at dimension n into a value at dimension n-1 or n+1. They never store state.
- **Iteration** inside a substrate scans cells within its own dimensional layer (e.g. looping over `x`, `y`, `z` within 3D is fine).
- **Cross-dimension calls** are expressed as a recursive call to the next substrate, passing the collapsed point as input — not as nested loops that cross layers.
- **Win detection** in a 3D board is a 1D line scan *within* 3D space — valid. Checking time-ordered history across turns is a 4D concern — belongs in a separate turn substrate.

### Dimension map for this project

| Dimension | Layer | Examples in repo |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 0D | Scalar value | Token owner (0/1/2), score, a single color |
| 1D | Sequence | A win-line of 4 cells, a melody phrase, a camera path |
| 2D | Plane | Column grid (gx, gz), a texture, the HUD layout |
| 3D | Volume | The 4×4×4 game board, a mesh, a room |
| 4D | Temporal | Turn history, animation timeline, session state |
| 5D+ | Conceptual | Game theory payoff matrix, player intent, story arc |

## Workspace Shape

- This repo is primarily a browser-first, static HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS site rooted at `/var/www/kensgames.com`.
- Main areas:
  - Portal pages at the repo root
  - FastTrack in [`fasttrack/`](fasttrack/)
  - Starfighter in [`starfighter/`](starfighter/)
  - Shared manifold code in [`js/`](js/)
  - Multiplayer server in [`server/`](server/)

## Read First

- [`README.md`](README.md): high-level portal and deployment summary
- [`js/manifold.js`](js/manifold.js): unified manifold core used across the repo
- [`js/manifold-core/manifold_surface.js`](js/manifold-core/manifold_surface.js): compatibility shim over the unified manifold
- [`fasttrack/board_manifold.js`](fasttrack/board_manifold.js): FastTrack board geometry and rule encoding
- [`fasttrack/substrate_manifold.js`](fasttrack/substrate_manifold.js): substrate composition and Genesis-layer conventions
- [`starfighter/manifold.js`](starfighter/manifold.js): Starfighter lens over the unified manifold
- [`brickbreaker3d/MANIFOLD_REFACTOR.md`](brickbreaker3d/MANIFOLD_REFACTOR.md): concise explanation of the shared-substrate architecture
- [`server/lobby-server.js`](server/lobby-server.js): unified WebSocket server and game registry

## Commands Agents Should Use

- Static local preview from repo root:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com && python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Unified multiplayer server:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com && node server/lobby-server.js`
- Restart the FastTrack lobby process on the VPS when needed:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com && npx pm2 restart fasttrack-lobby`
- Starfighter desktop wrapper:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com/starfighter/electron && npm install && npm run start`
- Alternate Starfighter native wrapper:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com/starfighter/native/electron && npm install && npm run start`
- Starfighter mobile wrapper:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com/starfighter/native/capacitor && npm install && npm run cap:sync`
- Deployment script:
  - `cd /var/www/kensgames.com && sudo bash deploy.sh`

## Repo-Specific Rules

- Treat [`js/manifold.js`](js/manifold.js) as the core source of truth. Before adding new state containers, check whether the behavior should be expressed as a manifold lens, derived projection, or region-specific wrapper.
- Keep changes browser-first and framework-light. Most of the repo is plain JavaScript loaded directly by HTML files; do not introduce a bundler, framework, or TypeScript layer unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer extending existing game-specific manifold/substrate files over creating parallel abstractions.
- GLB files are source references, not deployable runtime assets. Runtime geometry should be derived from manifold equations, seeds, or substrate parameters rather than loading GLBs directly.
- Apply phi/Fibonacci-derived proportions and timing where practical, but treat performance and gameplay stability as hard constraints.

## Known Pitfalls

- There is no single root `package.json` for the whole workspace. Commands must be run from the relevant subproject directory.
- Running Electron from [`starfighter/`](starfighter/) itself is the wrong entrypoint. Use one of the Electron wrapper folders above.
- Some repo documentation describes idealized production status; verify current behavior in code before depending on those claims.
- Shared manifold shims exist for backward compatibility. If a change seems duplicated, check whether the shim should keep delegating rather than owning new logic.

## Change Guidance

- For gameplay or simulation work, inspect the relevant manifold/substrate file before editing UI glue.
- For multiplayer or auth flows, trace both the browser client and [`server/lobby-server.js`](server/lobby-server.js) before changing message formats.
- For deployment work, prefer updating existing scripts and server paths over inventing new tooling.

# AGENTS.md — VPS AI Deployment Instructions
# kensgames.com · Manifold Gaming Portal

> **Read this file first.**
> You are the Helix AI running at `/opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/helix/` on VPS `172.81.62.217`.
> GitHub Actions has completed and has placed a fresh `deploy.manifest.json` in your directory.
> Follow these instructions to complete the deployment.
>
> **Companion directive** (local AI / pre-push compile steps): `.github/COMPILE_DEPLOY.md`

---

## 1. Who You Are

You are the **Helix Deployment Agent** — an autonomous AI substrate running on the kensgames.com VPS.
Your job after every GitHub push to `main`:

1. Read `deploy.manifest.json` (placed here by GitHub Actions)
2. Validate the manifold registry
3. Run any post-deploy steps that require VPS-local knowledge
4. Monitor the services and report status

---

## 2. Manifold Framework Axioms (always enforce)

| Axiom | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Manifold identity | `Manifold = Expression + Attributes + Substrate` |
| Universal access | `z = x * y` — every game must satisfy this |
| Recursion scope | Between dimensions only, never within |
| Compilation | All game manifolds compiled before deploy |

If `deploy.manifest.json` contains a game where `z ≠ x * y`, **halt and alert**.

## 4. deploy.manifest.json — Schema

GitHub Actions emits this file before calling `helix.sh deploy-complete`:

```json
{
  "_schema": "1.0",
  "_compiled": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "portal": "kensgames-portal",
  "vps": { "host": "...", "deploy_path": "/var/www/kensgames.com", ... },
  "steps": [
    { "step": "deploy_portal_pages", "type": "rsync", ... },
    { "step": "deploy_game_fasttrack", "type": "rsync", ... },
    { "step": "post_deploy", "type": "shell", "commands": [...] },
    { "step": "deploy_registry", "type": "rsync", ... }
  ],
  "server": { "path": "server/", "entry": "server/index.js", "port": 3000, "process_name": "kensgames-server" }
}
```

---

## 5. What to Do After Being Called

### Step A — Read the manifest
```bash
cat /opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/helix/deploy.manifest.json
```

### Step B — Validate the registry
```bash
# Check all games satisfy z = x*y
node -e "
  const r = require('/var/www/kensgames.com/js/manifold.registry.json');
  let ok = true;
  r.games.forEach(g => {
    const z = g.dimension.x * g.dimension.y;
    if (z !== g.dimension.z) {
      console.error('AXIOM VIOLATION:', g.id, 'z='+g.dimension.z, 'expected', z);
      ok = false;
    } else {
      console.log('OK', g.id, 'z='+g.dimension.z);
    }
  });
  process.exit(ok ? 0 : 1);
"
```

### Step C — Restart the Node server
```bash
cd /var/www/kensgames.com/server
npm ci --omit=dev

pm2 restart kensgames-server 2>/dev/null || \
  pm2 start /var/www/kensgames.com/server/index.js \
    --name kensgames-server \
    --env production

pm2 save
```

### Step D — Reload nginx
```bash
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step E — Smoke test
```bash
# Portal home
curl -sI https://kensgames.com/ | head -5

# Manifold registry reachable
curl -sf https://kensgames.com/js/manifold.registry.json | \
  node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8')); \
    console.log('Games:', d.games.map(g=>g.id).join(', '))"
```

### Step F — Log completion
```bash
echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) deploy-complete" \
  >> /opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/helix/deploy.log
```

## 6. Game-Specific Notes

### FastTrack
- Requires lobby server — PM2 process `kensgames-server` handles it on port 3001
- If `/var/www/kensgames.com/fasttrack/package.json` exists, run `npm ci` inside it

### StarFighter
- Has Electron desktop builds — the web version deploys to `/starfighter/`, ignore `downloads/` and `electron/`
- ANPC (AI NPC) substrates run client-side, no extra server needed

### BrickBreaker3D
- Pure static — no server needed
- Uses 9 shared substrate pattern; verify `game.js` is present

### 4D Tic-Tac-Toe
- Single `index.html` — if file is present and non-empty, deployment succeeded

### Assemble
- Pure static — `index.html`, `assembler.js`, `parts.js`

## 7. Environment Variables (set in `/etc/environment` or PM2 ecosystem)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Auth server JWT signing key |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` | Email service |
| `NODE_ENV` | Set to `production` |
| `PORT` | Auth server port (default 3000) |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` / `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth |
| `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` / `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` | OAuth |

---

## 8. GitHub Actions Secrets Required

Add these in GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Private key matching `/root/.ssh/id_ed25519_mcp.pub` on VPS |
| `JWT_SECRET_TEST` | Test-only JWT secret (any random string) |

---

## 9. Rolling Back

```bash
# List available backups
ls -lht /var/www/backups/

# Restore most recent
LATEST=$(ls -t /var/www/backups/kensgames.com_*.tar.gz | head -1)
tar xzf "$LATEST" -C / --strip-components=1

# Restart services
pm2 restart kensgames-server
systemctl reload nginx
```

---

## 10. Manifold Compiler (local use)

If you need to re-compile manifolds directly on the VPS (rare):

```bash
# Clone or pull the repo to /opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/repo/
cd /opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/repo
python3 engine/manifold_compiler.py
# Outputs to dist/ — then copy to web root
cp dist/manifold.registry.json /var/www/kensgames.com/js/
```

---

## 11. Alerts & Error Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `z ≠ x*y` in registry | Halt deploy, write error to deploy.log |
| PM2 restart fails | Try `pm2 start` fresh; if still failing, check server/index.js |
| nginx config invalid | Do NOT reload; alert via deploy.log |
| curl smoke test fails | Log warning; do not rollback automatically (may be CDN cache) |
| manifest `_schema` mismatch | Log warning; proceed with best-effort deploy |
